# Chatbot Project using Flask and GPT-3

This chatbot project is an interactive web-based application that allows users to have real-time conversations with a chatbot. It utilizes Flask, a Python web framework, and OpenAI's GPT-3 for natural language processing to generate human-like responses.

## Features

- Real-time chat with a chatbot powered by GPT-3.
- A user-friendly and minimalist web interface.
- Easy customization and extensibility for various use cases.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.
- An OpenAI GPT-3 API key. If you don't have one, you can sign up for an API key at [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/signup/).

## Installation

1. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

bash
Copy code
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
Usage
Run the Flask app:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to start chatting with the chatbot.

Configuration
You can customize the chatbot's behavior by modifying the Flask app or adjusting the GPT-3 integration in the app.py file. Feel free to explore and tailor the chatbot to meet your specific requirements.
